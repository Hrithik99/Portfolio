Clustering: Strategic New Fitness Centers in Los Angeles
The overall goal is to minimize travel for all Los Angeles residents in need of access to a local gym while promoting health across the city. The objective of this project in particular is to determine optimal locations for a new gym or fitness center within Los Angeles. Specifically, the end result is to compile a list of Los Angeles neighborhoods that have no gyms or fitness centers within 3000 meters from their center points.
